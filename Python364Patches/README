See the edits of Final.diff

Patch Final.diff and use setup.diff (as a example) to compile modules. 
Run autoconf

./configure --host=aarch64-apple-darwin17 --build=<YOUR-HOST-OS-TRIPLE> <ARGS>
/* A config file from python has the configure args for the electra compile I did. /*

After running the configure script with the Final2.patch:
Edit ./config.status and make sure you don't have -undefined dynamic_lookup in any of your flags (or something along those lines.
Run ./config.status
/* I tried to patch it out, but got lazy when the changes failed the first time. /*

Other files are just aids I used (and otherwise have no use).

MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET getting set prevents ipv6 support! You should look to fix that.
