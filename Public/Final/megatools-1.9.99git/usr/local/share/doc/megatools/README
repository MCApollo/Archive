megatools - command line client application for Mega
====================================================

Megatools is a collection of programs for accessing Mega service from
a command line of your desktop or server.

Megatools allow you to copy individual files as well as entire directory
trees to and from the cloud. You can also perform streaming downloads for
example to preview videos and audio files, without needing to download
the entire file.

Megatools are robust and optimized for fast operation - as fast as Mega
servers allow. Memory requirements and CPU utilization are kept at minimum.

You can register account using a 'megareg' tool, with the benefit of having
true control of your encryption keys.

Mega website can be found at https://mega.nz.

Megatools can be downloaded at https://megatools.megous.com


Tools
=====

  megareg      Register and verify a new mega account
  megadf       Show your cloud storage space usage/quota
  megals       List all remote files
  megamkdir    Create remote directory
  megarm       Remove remote file or directory
  megaput      Upload individual files
  megaget      Download individual files
  megadl       Download file from a "public" Mega link
               (doesn't require login)
  megacopy     Upload or download a directory tree


All of these tools do:

- Local caching of remote session/filesystem information
  for faster execution. Cache is encrypted with your password
  key.
- Support loading login credentials from a configuration file


Usage
=====

See man pages for how to use individual tools and how to configure them:

  man megatools

Man pages are also available online at:

  https://megatools.megous.com/man/megatools.html


Installation on Windows
=======================

Megatools is available on Windows via Chocolatey thanks to ERap320. See:

  https://chocolatey.org/packages/megatools/

You can contact the package maintainer here:

  https://github.com/megous/megatools/issues/347


Windows Quirks
==============

On Windows, if you see weird characters in your megals output, you'll need
to set correct CHARSET environment variable. For example on Czech Windows
this would mean executing this command in cmd before using the tools:

  set CHARSET=CP852

This is just a cosmetic issue. Internally, megatools always work with UTF-8
file names, and even if the tool's terminal output is corrupted, files names
of downloaded/uploaded files will be correct.


Installation on Mac OS X (Mountain Lion)
========================================

Thanks to Carl Moden, megatools is available in Homebrew (http://brew.sh/).

You can therefore install megatools with:

  brew install megatools


Installation on your favorite GNU/Linux distribution
====================================================

Megatools may already be pre-packaged in the package repository
of your distribution. It is already available at least in:

- Debian - https://packages.debian.org/stretch/megatools
- Ubuntu - https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/megatools
- Fedora - https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/package/rpms/megatools/
- Arch Linux (AUR) - https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/megatools/
- Gentoo - https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/net-misc/megatools

Be sure to check your distribution's package repository first.


Installation on FreeBSD
=======================

Megatools is available in ports thanks to Maxim V. Kostikov:

  http://www.freshports.org/net/megatools/


Building megatools from source code
===================================

You will need to install dependnencies first, to be able to do the build from
the official source code tarball, which is available only at
http://megatools.megous.com.

You can also check that the code was released by me, using PGP signatures
provided alongside the code.

Please don't report build issues against code that you downloaded from github.
These reports will be closed without explanation, with reference to this README
file. It is not expected to work on all distributions. Use the official tarball.


On Debian, Ubuntu:

  apt-get -y install build-essential libglib2.0-dev libssl-dev \
    libcurl4-openssl-dev

  Note: when you run into missing .so files, try building with 
    `./configure --disable-shared --enable-static` instead of plain `./configure`.

On Fedora:

  yum -y install gcc make glib2-devel libcurl-devel openssl-devel gmp-devel tar

On OpenSUSE:

  zypper -n install gcc make glib2-devel libcurl-devel openssl-devel gmp-devel

On Arch Linux:

  pacman -Sy --noconfirm --needed pkg-config gcc make glib2 curl gmp nettle

On Alpine Linux:

  apk add --update build-base libcurl curl-dev asciidoc openssl-dev glib-dev \
    glib libtool automake autoconf


Third party tools/scripts
=========================

Megatools are meant as a low-level tools that can be used as a base to create
more complicated tools for working with mega.nz. Other people have created
a third party scripts on top of megatools. If you're one of them and want to
have your project listed here, let me know.

Some third party tools can be found at:

Support and bug reports
=======================

If you think you've found bug in megatools, send a report including enough
information for recreating the issue to: megous@megous.com

IMPORTANT: I use personal e-mail server for my e-mail communication. I respond
to most e-mails, so if you are not getting a response within a few days, and
you're a user of a more aggressive e-mail provider (Outlook, iCloud, ...) it may
be because your provider rejected my e-mail as SPAM and did not deliver it at
all (not even to your SPAM folder), despite it being response to your e-mail and
my server using industry's best practices. You can either contact your e-mail
provider so that they fix their issue with rejecting legitimate responses to
your mail, or use different e-mail provider or contact channel to contact me.
