.SS "Description"
\fCbegin\fP is used to create a new block of code\&.
.PP
The block is unconditionally executed\&. \fCbegin; \&.\&.\&.; end\fP is equivalent to \fCif true; \&.\&.\&.; end\fP\&.
.PP
\fCbegin\fP is used to group a number of commands into a block\&. This allows the introduction of a new variable scope, redirection of the input or output of a set of commands as a group, or to specify precedence when using the conditional commands like \fCand\fP\&.
.PP
\fCbegin\fP does not change the current exit status itself\&. After the block has completed, \fC$status\fP will be set to the status returned by the most recent command\&.
.SS "Example"
The following code sets a number of variables inside of a block scope\&. Since the variables are set inside the block and have local scope, they will be automatically deleted when the block ends\&.
