.SS "Description"
This is implemented as a function and a builtin\&. The function will attempt to use an external realpath command if one can be found\&. Otherwise it falls back to the builtin\&. The builtin does not support any options\&. It's meant to be used only by scripts which need to be portable\&. The builtin implementation behaves like GNU realpath when invoked without any options (which is the most common use case)\&. In general scripts should not invoke the builtin directly\&. They should just use \fCrealpath\fP\&.
.PP
If the path is invalid no translated path will be written to stdout and an error will be reported\&.
