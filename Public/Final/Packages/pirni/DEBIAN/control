Description: Pirni is a packet sniffer for the iPhone written by Axel Moller (n1mda)
	Includes pirni-derv in /usr/local/pirni-derv 
	Scripts derv has two main scripts: b4.sh 
	Initiates Pirni with router's IP address, packet filter, port, and filename.
	derv.sh:
	Reads Pirni's packet dump file in 'real time' and displays information gathered from the packets.
	About:
	Pirni dumps sniffed packets to a file. These packets can be later transferred to a computer and viewed using a packet-viewing program such as WireShark. This method, however, takes a lot of time and is very byzantine.
	Sign BigBoss's libnet before use!
