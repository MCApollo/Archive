	LULSHOTZ' messages:
	Grab a iPhoneOS SDK, rename it to SDK, and put it in /usr for gem.
	Have /usr/SDK/usr! It's used as a sysroot for gems.
	HAVE A SDK OR RUBY GEMS WILL /NOT/ WORK.
	Update May 12th:
	Rebuilded ruby, ruby gems should have a better chance of installing.
	Recommended to install pkg-config as some gems use it.
	ELECTRA CANNOT RUN CONFIGURE SCRIPTS; you're going to have to get your hands dirty
	Hint: cd into the directory and do 'ruby -I. extconf.rb -- --use-system-libraries' to generate a makefile and from there you can just run make.
	Hint: Everything most be codesigned, you may need to sign some gems after they been installed with ldid.
	I'll do my best to support LIBS you may need for some gems, just PM me on reddit.
	Don't come to me unless you googled and still cannot figure something out with ruby gems.
	Update 2:
	Recompile to include BigDecimal
